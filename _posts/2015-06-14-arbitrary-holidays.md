Today is June 14, 2015&mdash;otherwise known as Flag Day in the United States. Apparently, it is also National Bourbon Day and National Strawberry Shortcake Day. And who could forget Pop Goes The Weasel Day?

It seems like there is a collection of arbitrary holidays celebrated every day of the year. Whether its eating donuts or looking at male pattern baldness, we can find something to celebrate in every day.
