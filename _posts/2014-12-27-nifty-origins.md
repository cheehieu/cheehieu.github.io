Once upon a time...

## Prologue
The domain name originates from a childhood fascination with Sonic the Hedgehog. In my younger years, I spent a lot of time reading his comic books and playing the video games; running fast and collecting gold rings became my priorities... and in some ways, remnants of those priorities are instilled today. The words "nifty" and "hedgehog" are a play on my real name's initials. Take the reverse initialism of the domain and you get "HN", the initials for Hieu Nguyen. Yes, it's obscure and extremely nonsensical, but that's how it truly happened.
