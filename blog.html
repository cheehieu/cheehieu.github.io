				<p>I'm not a very good speaker. I don't thrive in high-pressure situations where I need to quickly articulate thoughts into cohesive diction. The English language is a work of art, and unfortunately, I am not a speed painter. I prefer to choose my words carefully, so that my ideas are communicated more accurately and effectively.</p>
				<p>This blog will feature random ramblings about life and philosophy, with a mix of science and technology. Some posts will be informative drivel, while others will be outbursts of creative writing. I have a voice, and I'd like to share it with others. My goal is to create at least one post per month. I think that's doable.</p>

				<h4>Google Alerts for "Hieu Nguyen"</h4>
				<!--Collection of "Hieu Nguyen" Google alerts, quotes, links to articles.-->
				<p>I have a very common name, akin to a "James Smith" or a "Mary Johnson" found in the United States. This makes it rather difficult to stand out in the world. I'll probably never attain a high level of notoriety from my name alone. There's no way I can join the elite group of mononymous individuals who can get by on a first name basis, such as Oprah, Beyonce, or Adolf. It's nice sometimes to have that anonymity; I am not easily found without the use of unique keywords in a web search. 				<p>There can only be one.</p>
				<p>Make headlines. Hope not to get mistaken for.</p>
