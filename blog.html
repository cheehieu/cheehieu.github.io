				<!--p>I'm not a very good speaker. I don't thrive in high-pressure situations where I need to quickly articulate thoughts into cohesive diction. The English language is a work of art, and unfortunately, I am not a speed painter. I prefer to choose my words carefully, so that my ideas are communicated more accurately and effectively.  I have a voice, and I'd like to share it with others. </p-->

				<p>This Jekyll-based blog features random ramblings about life and philosophy, with a smidge of science and technology. Some posts will be informative drivel, while others will be outbursts of creative writing. I'm not a great writer, but my goal is to create at least one interesting post per month. I think that's doable.</p>
