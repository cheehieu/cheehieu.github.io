				<!--p>I'm not a very good speaker. I don't thrive in high-pressure situations where I need to quickly articulate thoughts into cohesive diction. The English language is a work of art, and unfortunately, I am not a speed painter. I prefer to choose my words carefully, so that my ideas are communicated more accurately and effectively.  I have a voice, and I'd like to share it with others. </p-->
				<p>This blog will feature random ramblings about life and philosophy, with a mix of science and technology. Some posts will be informative drivel, while others will be outbursts of creative writing. My goal is to create at least one post per month. I think that's doable.</p>

				<h4>Google Alerts for "Hieu Nguyen"</h4>
				<!--Collection of "Hieu Nguyen" Google alerts, quotes, links to articles.-->
				<p>I have a very common name, akin to a "James Smith" or a "Mary Johnson" found in the United States. This makes it rather difficult to stand out in the world. My name doesn't have a particularly unique ring to it, one that's allowed Oprah, Beyonce, Adolf, and the like to attain worldwide notoriety.</p>
				<p>However, it's nice sometimes to have a level of anonymity; I am not easily found in a web search. Below is a compilation of Google Alerts for "Hieu Nguyen" that I've collected over the years. It's my way of keeping track of my moniker brothers and sisters. Any and all noteworthy accomplishments are recorded.</p>
				<p>There can only be one.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Hieu #1</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Hieu #2</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Hieu #3</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Hieu #4</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Hieu #5</a></li>
				</ul>
